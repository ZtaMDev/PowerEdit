# Download Source

This feature allows users to download the editor's source code directly from within the application.

To use it, go to **Help â†’ Download Source Code**, and a download menu will appear.

- First, select the folder where you want to save the files (by default, it is set to the user's Documents folder).
- Then, simply click the download button to fetch the source code directly from GitHub.

This makes it easy and quick to get the latest code without leaving the editor.
