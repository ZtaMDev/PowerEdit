# File Explorer

The **File Explorer** provides a structured view of the current project directory. It allows users to interact with files and folders in a simple and integrated way, making it easier to manage the contents of a project.

## Core Features

- **Display Project Structure**  
  Shows all files and folders within the selected project root.

- **Create, Delete, and Rename**  
  You can create new files or folders, delete existing ones, and rename them directly from the explorer.

> **Note:** More features are coming soon, including copy/paste, file properties, and more advanced file operations.

## Project Management

The File Explorer plays a key role in managing your project:
- It serves as the entry point for all project resources.
- It ensures that the editor loads and interacts with the correct files.
- It supports workflows like file opening, saving, and navigation.

## Theming Support

The explorer also adapts visually to the **active theme** selected in PowerEdit. This includes:
- Coloring of files and folders to match the themeâ€™s palette.
- Highlighted selection styles that reflect the current color scheme.
- Seamless integration with light and dark modes, as defined in the `.theme` file.

This makes the explorer not only functional but also aesthetically consistent with the rest of the editor interface.

It is tightly integrated with other components such as the [Editor](editor.md) and [Live Preview](live-preview.md), ensuring everything stays in sync while you work.
