# Console

The **Console** is a fundamental component in PowerEdit, essential for developers working with command-line tools and frameworks such as Flask, Django, or Node.js.

## Features

- **Command Execution**  
  You can run shell commands directly through the input field located at the bottom of the editor interface.

- **Stop Active Processes**  
  To stop a running command (such as a server), simply press `Ctrl+C` inside the console input.

- **Open Live Preview Links**  
  When working with frameworks that launch a local server (like Flask), the console automatically detects and makes links clickable.

- **Theme Integration**  
  The console automatically adapts to the current color theme for a seamless visual experience.

## Notes

- ⚠️ **In Development:**  
  Full support for standard shell commands is still under development. The goal is to make the console behave like a native Windows or Unix terminal.

- 🧱 **Modular Layout Coming Soon:**  
  In future versions, both the Console and the File Explorer will become modular components, allowing you to dock and position them anywhere in the editor layout.
