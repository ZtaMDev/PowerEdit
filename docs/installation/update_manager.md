# Update Manager

PowerEdit includes a built-in update manager that automatically checks for the latest releases on GitHub, downloads them, and installs them for you.

## How it works and how to use it

- The update manager always launches before the editor itself.  
  > _(Note: This is why PowerEdit may take a little longer to open. In the future, an option will be added to disable the update manager by default.)_

- When executed, it checks the GitHub releases of PowerEdit and compares the current version with the latest one based on the release tags.

- If a new version is available, the update manager UI is launched.

---

## Step-by-step process:

- **Initial prompt**  
   - The first window will ask whether you want to update.  
   > Updates may introduce bugs or other considerations, so choose wisely.

   - If you select **Yes**, the update process continues.
   - If you select **No**, PowerEdit will launch without updating.

- **Update interface**  
   If you choose to update, you will see two buttons:
   - `Download Install`
   - `Start PowerEdit`

   - To update, simply click **Download Instal**.
   - The installer for the new version will be downloaded and automatically launched.
