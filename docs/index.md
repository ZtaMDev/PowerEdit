# Welcome to PowerEdit

**PowerEdit** is a lightweight, customizable code editor built with PyQt5 after a month of continuous development. Here youâ€™ll find everything you need to:

- **Install** and get started in minutes  
- **Master** its interface and workflows  
- **Create** and apply your own **themes** (`.theme` files)  
- **Develop** extensions with **`.extend`** packs  
- **Keep** it up to date automatically  

> ðŸŽ¯ _Our goal_ is to provide you with a simple, fast, and extensible experience.  
> Explore the documentation using the left-hand menu and begin your journey with PowerEdit!

> **Hello!**  
> Iâ€™m very proud to launch this projectâ€”Iâ€™ve been developing it for one month, and in my opinion it has come a long way.  
> Iâ€™m publishing it on GitHub so everyone can use it. The editor works quite well, and Iâ€™d love your help to improve it as much as possible,  
> since this is my first open-source project of this kind and I want to take it to the next level.  
>  
> It includes an **Update Manager** that will keep the editor on the latest version,  
> and a **Source Downloader**: under **Help â†’ Download Source** you can grab the entire codebase for editing.  
> (I recommend using VS Code rather than PowerEdit for editing, since there are still some indentation quirks in the editor.)  
>  
> With your help, I hope to iron out those issues, add new features, and soon introduce AIâ€¦ completely free of charge!
