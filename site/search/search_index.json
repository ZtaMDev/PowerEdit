I\u2019m very proud to launch this project\u2014I\u2019ve been developing it for one month, and in my opinion it has come a long way. I\u2019m publishing it on GitHub so everyone can use it. The editor works quite well, and I\u2019d love your help to improve it as much as possible, since this is my first open-source project of this kind and I want to take it to the next level.  </p> <p>It includes an Update Manager that will keep the editor on the latest version, and a Source Downloader: under Help \u2192 Download Source you can grab the entire codebase for editing. (I recommend using VS Code rather than PowerEdit for editing, since there are still some indentation quirks in the editor.)  </p> <p>With your help, I hope to iron out those issues, add new features, and soon introduce AI\u2026 completely free of charge!</p>"},{"location":"release_notes/","title":"Release Notes","text":"<p>Hola!
